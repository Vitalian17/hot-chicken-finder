Process of construction:

API Integration:
1. Finding the appropriate APIs for the project.(In this case Google Maps and Yelp Fusion)
2. Combing through Documentation to find the correct functions to Implement.
3. Having Google Maps appear on the webage itself.
4. Localizing Google Maps to Nashville specifically.
5. Using the Yelp API to return any hot chicken results for the greater Nashville area.
6. Using Google Maps to populate the map with markers correlating with the location of the restaurants.
7. Finding the users geolocation instead of a default marker.
8. Creating a condition in case the user blocked location finding.
9. Fixing an error that caused the marker to default to one particular restaurant.
10. Changing the markers to bouncing chickens.

Front End:

1. Made basic HTML skeleton
2. Found appropriate background image
3. Added picture slideshows
4. Used flexboxes for majority of divs (slideshows, map, results)
5. Used Pure framework for button
6. Populated hot chicken results using Yelp API
7. Had to implement media queries in JS due to chicken icons not being mobile device compatable
